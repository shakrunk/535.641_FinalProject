## -------------------------------- ##

# Test compute_sml() for correct focus measurement
# Compute the SML score for both the sharp and blurred images
# Assert that the SML score of the sharp image is significantly higher than the blurred one
# Assert that the output SML map has the same dimensions as the input image
# Assert that the output SML map is a floating-point array (e.g., np.float64)

# Test create_focus_decision_map() for correct index mapping
# Create a list of three simple, known 2x2 SML maps where the max value is in a different location for each pixel
# Define the expected 2x2 decision map where each pixel's value is the index (0, 1, or 2) of the max SML value
# Generate the actual decision map using the function
# Assert that the generated decision map is identical to the expected decision map (using np.array_equal)

# Test fuse_pyramids() for correct pixel fusion logic
# Create two simple, known Laplacian pyramids (e.g., one pyramid of all 1s, one of all 10s)
# Create a known 2x2 decision map (e.g., [[0, 1], [1, 0]])
# Call fuse_pyramids() with the known pyramids and decision map
# Manually calculate the expected fused result (e.g., a combination of 1s and 10s based on the map)
# Assert that the function's output is identical to the expected result

# Test build_gaussian_pyramid() and build_laplacian_pyramid() for correct structure
# Create a sample 128x128 grayscale image
# Build a pyramid with a specific number of levels (e.g., 4)
# Assert that the returned pyramid is a list containing the correct number of images (e.g., 4)
# Assert that the dimensions of each image in the pyramid are halved at each level (128x128 -> 64x64 -> 32x32 -> 16x16)

## Integration Tests                ##
## -------------------------------- ##

# Test the full process_z_stack() pipeline on predictable synthetic data
# Create a synthetic z-stack of two images:
#  - Image 1: Sharp on the left half, blurry on the right
#  - Image 2: Blurry on the left half, sharp on the right
# Process the synthetic z-stack using the main pipeline function
# Assert that the output fused image has the same dimensions as the input images
# Assert that the output data type is uint8
# Assert that the left half of the output image is primarily sourced from Image 1
# Assert that the right half of the output image is primarily sourced from Image 2

# Create a smoke test for the full process_z_stack() pipeline on real data
# Load a small, real-world z-stack from the TEST_DATA_DIR
# Run the complete process_z_stack() function on this data
# Assert that the function executes without raising an exception
# Assert that the returned image is a non-empty NumPy array with the expected dimensions and uint8 data type

## Edge Case & Error Handling Tests ##
## -------------------------------- ##

# Test pipeline behavior with invalid inputs
# Assert that calling process_z_stack() with an empty list of images raises a ValueError
# Assert that calling process_z_stack() with only one image returns that same image without processing
# Assert that calling process_z_stack() with images of different dimensions raises a ValueError

# Test pipeline behavior with invalid parameters
# Assert that calling compute_sml() with an invalid kernel_size (e.g., 0, even number) raises a ValueError
# Assert that calling pyramid functions with an invalid number of levels (e.g., 0, negative) raises a ValueError
