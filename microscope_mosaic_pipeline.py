"""Automated Wide-Field Mosaic and Multi-Focus Fusion of Microscopy Images.

This module implements a two-stage pipeline to generate a single, all-in-focus,
wide-field mosaic from a collection of microscopy z-stacks.  The process first
creates an all-in-focus image from each z-stack (focus stacking) and then
stitches these focused images together into a final panoramic mosaic.

This script was developed by Krishna A. Kumar and Nicholas Merten for the course
535.641 Mathematical Methods at Johns Hopkins University, in collaboration with
the Rocky Mountain Lion's Eye Bank (RMLEB). Copyright (2025)

Pipeline Stages
---
1. **Focus Stacking**: Uses a Laplacian pyramid fusion technique guided by a
   Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML) focus measure to combine a z-stack of images
   into a single, sharp composite image.
2. **Mosaic Stitching**: Stitches the resulting all-in-focus images into a 
   seamless panorama using ORB feature detection, feature matching, and robust
   homography estimation with RANSAC.
