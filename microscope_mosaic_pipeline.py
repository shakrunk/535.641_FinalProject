"""Automated Wide-Field Mosaic and Multi-Focus Fusion of Microscopy Images.

This module implements a two-stage pipeline to generate a single, all-in-focus,
wide-field mosaic from a collection of microscopy z-stacks.  The process first
creates an all-in-focus image from each z-stack (focus stacking) and then
stitches these focused images together into a final panoramic mosaic.

Pipeline Stages
---
1. **Focus Stacking**: Uses a Laplacian pyramid fusion technique guided by a
   Sum-Modified-Laplacian (SML) focus measure to combine a z-stack of images
   into a single, sharp composite image.
2. **Mosaic Stitching**: Stitches the resulting all-in-focus images into a 
   seamless panorama using ORB feature detection, feature matching, and robust
   homography estimation with RANSAC.
